Proposed Transactions Table
-----
The current platform has every system keeping their own transaction records or database. This has resulted in a multitude of database cluster in the ETZ environment. Eg major clients to AS eg FundGate, Justpay all keep their
independent tables to store their transactions data.
This new platform avoids this by having a central database for all transactions. These tables will be well designed to cater for any specific use case and be able to satify all data requirements that will arise

Components of the transaction data
---------------
1. Merchant data
2. Transaction data
2. Sender data
4. Receiver data
5. Processor data
6. Switch data
7. state data
8. Security data
9. Time data
10. Metrics data
11. Settlement data


TRANSACTION TABLE DESIGN/ANALYSIS
==================================
1.	Merchant data
	1. merchantCode
	2. accountId  xxx
	3. bankCode	  xxx

	
2. Transaction data
	1. serviceCode xxx
	2. amount
	3. debitAccount
	4. creditAccount
	5. description  (format can be agreed)
	6. debitBankCode
	7. creditBankCode
	8  fee
    9. elevy
	10. merchantReference
	11. reference
	12. customerReference (reference entered by customer)  - 
	13. product  (eg MTN airtime, Vodacash Momo debit, DSTV:accountnumber). ie descriptive narrative of the main item been been transacted - not for public
	14. cardNumber
	15. payment_type   xxx
	16. channel	
	
	
	
3. Sender data  - do we have to store any of these data, do they breach privacy
	1. senderName  xxx
	2. senderMobile  
	3. Location (useful for remmittance, location can be country)  xxx
	
	
4. Receiver data - do we have to store any of these data, do they breach privacy
	1. receiverName  xxx
	2. receiverMobile  xxx
	3. location  xxx
	
	
5. Debit Processor data
	1. processer (eg GIP, MTN , GCB) l  xxx
	2. processorReference			   xxx
	3. processorResponseCode		   xxx
	4. processorMessage				   xxx
	

7. Switch data
	1. transcode					 
	2. response_code
	3. switchReference  (shd be sequential) - xxxx
	4. switchNarration  xxx
	5. Flag   (help to indicate status such as reversed, etc) 0=processed, reversed
	6. route/node id    xxxx
	

8. other data
	process_attempt   xxx


9. state_data
	error_history eg 58#0,6   xxx
	state eg status checked   xxx
	
10. SecurityData
	1. mac
	2. request id


11. Metrics data   -  ref,  sourcebankcode, creditbankcode, tat, dr_tat, cr_tat, insert tat1, update tat1, insert tat2, update tat2,   - will be done in a separate thread
	1. txn_tat processingTime(TAT)   xxx
	2. dbInsertTAT					 xxx
	3. dbUpdateTAT					 xxx
	

12. Time data  - tabl1 and tabl2 will all have these columns
	1. requestTime
	2. responseTime
	
	
	
	table ddl column names table name  transaction
	id,
	merchant_code,   idx = merchant_code
	reference, merchant_reference, amount, fee, elevy, card_number, debit_account, debit_bank_code, credit_account, credit_bank_code, description, customer_reference, product, channel
	   idx =  card_number, debit_account, debit_bank_code, credit_account, credit_bank_code, amount, description, merchant_reference, reference, product, channel
	sender_mobile	idx = senderMobile	
	trans_code, response_code, flag   idx = trans_code, response_code, switch_reference, switch_flag	
	mac, request_id	
	request_time, response_time     idx = request_time, response_time
	
	
	note: trans_code table: do we need it? shd be hard coded in a class so a devloper can access all the various transacodes during impl
