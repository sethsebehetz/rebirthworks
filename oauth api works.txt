get accesstoken
 -H client_id   - plain client id
 -H client_secret  - rsa(client_secret . timestamp(yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS)

steps
1. check required parameters are present
   if any is null return error missing required parameters - HC 401
   
   check grant type

2. use client_id to get merchant
   if no merchant is found return error invalid api key - HC 401

3. Use kid from merchant to get key records

4. decrypt client secret using the merchant private keys
   seperate client secret and timestamp

5. compare client secret received to merchant client secret 
   if its not the same return HC 401

6. check timestamp if it is older than 10mins
   note: timestamp is the GMT time of sending the request. it should not be 10mins behind current time and also not be 10mins ahead of current time
   timestamp is used here to stop the activities of middlement or hackers who have gained access to the request in transport. 
   in such a case the checks can reduce the extent of the damage that can be done
