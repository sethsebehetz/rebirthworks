LS Flow
---
1. incoming request
2. security checks (authentication) and request body decryption - done by ls auth filter
3. request validation - format, amount etc
4. generate mac, switch reference
security checks - check digit, account statu(if blocked), cms checks
5.txn logging for funds mvt requests. no logging for balance,statement etc - txn, txn_detail
6. route request - request data to route, format and security, see ecarddb.e_tmcnode;, (see efrontend ecarddb.interface table columns (active,allow_web), see ecarddb.e_tmckey for key exchange
7. call cms webservice(if it applies) - this is determined from route property of issuer code
8. txn update
9. Add merchant data to request

8. save response (00 success, 31 failed, 06 failed)



gen mac, 
gen switch ref - in app or from table (sequential)
call cms logic to use
LS Error codes determination, error codes table(caching and crud/refresh)
LS response json
records logging: do we log once(one insert) or we update after logging - brain storming

routing module brain storming
key exchange

bulkhead: intelligence when node is failing consecutively or is down


TODO
momo engine logic,implementation
reversal logic/implementation 
   see ecardb.e_reversal table
   method markReversed(reference) = updates columns to reversal status. 
reprocessing
how does ls updates it data eg, the data loaded into cache like transcodes etc

prerequisite models
-------------
transcode table
bank codes
node
route table
transaction request
transaction response
error codes


what is the security on routing?
  key exchange and data encryption, can we do mac on txn posted
  ip whitelisting? NO
  

LS Start
--
 1.  Tables to load to memory/cache
		1. load node, routes to memory/cache - active routes. auto refresh will reload routes activated or new routes added 
			methods - load routes, load route
	    2. transcode
		3. banks code table
		4. error codes
		
		note: crud apis, auto refresh for all
		
2. start key exchange check file LS Key exchange
3. LS flow - check file LS development

if request comes u check if the route kx is complete
